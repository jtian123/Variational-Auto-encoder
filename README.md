# Variational-Auto-encoder

## Project goal: The effectiveness of a Denoising Variational Auto-encoder for image denoising problem

This was a master course project completed at Utrecht University, Netherlands, on April 2021-June 2021

Main jobs: 

  • Designed Variational Auto-encoder(VAE) by Pytorch to investigate effectiveness for image denoising problems on MNIST- Fashion dataset. Trained DVAE model by carrying unsupervised training with L2-norm loss. Added additive Gaussian noise to images and compared reconstruction with original for varying latent dimensions.
  
  • Improved VAE model by fine tuning hyper-parameters based on Structural Image Similarity Score (SSIM) and Peak signal- to-noise ratio (PSNR) criteria.
  
  • Analyzed DVAE model with truncated principal components analysis and fourier low-pass filter, achieved 20% image de- noising efficiency by VAE.
